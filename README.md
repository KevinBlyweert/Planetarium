# Pl@netarium

Here is a full Vanilla JS solar system, on an HTML canvas.
Planets speeds et sizes are volontarly shifted to fit the view.
Speed in km/h decreased by a million as I'm still trying to figure out how to represent real planet velocities, sizes exagerrated (x50 for Sun, 1500 for planets)

Still going for improvements, enjoy and come back later ;)!

## Note for future updates : 
* Adding PNG for a more real experience of planets appearance
* Shadows from sun
* Upgrading code to TypeScripts
